WARNING ! This $0 file is provided just for lazy developers to
quickly build this module directly from source, and hack it. However this
module is managed by Dist::Zilla. Serious developers should install
Dist::Zilla, and issue 'dist help' to see how to build and develop it properly.
Especially, build/test/install requires are not properly set in this
file.

Contact the author if you need more help.

Now sleeping 10 secs so you get bored and go install Dist::Zilla :)\n\n";
